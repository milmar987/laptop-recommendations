Not sure which laptop to get for your studies? We got you covered!

<br />

## Windows

Below you find our Laptop recommendations for Windows powered devices. All recommended laptops come with 32Gb of RAM and the latest Intel CPU platform, Lunar Lake, Intel Ultra 7 258V. This CPU is mostly geared towards portable and slim workstations, exactly what you need for all of IFIs courses, including machine learning and AI masters. The choice for this CPU platform was made to ensure that

- the laptop can get you through your whole studies

- all of the latest AI features of Windows are supported

- all devices and monitors offered at UZH can be plugged in

- headroom is available for future hardware requirements

Inside the respective categories, the laptops are ordered by price, ascending. They offer identical performance and your choice mostly depends on personal preference, screen size and budget.



**Conventional Laptops, great if you already have an iPad / Tablet**

---

1. Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i Gen 9 Aura Edition (15" Intel) - *Recommended configuration:* [Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i Gen 9 Aura Edition (15″ Intel) \| KI-gestützte Kreativität \| 83HMCTO1WWCH3 \| Lenovo Schweiz](<https://www.lenovo.com/ch/de/p/laptops/yoga/yoga-slim-series/yoga-slim-7i-gen-9-aura-edition-15-inch-intel/83hmcto1wwch3>)
    - Display
        - 15\.3 Inch, 16:10

        - 2880 x 1800, 120Hz

        - Touch support

    - 70Wh battery

    - 1\.46 Kg

    - Notes

        - The Lenovo Yoga series offer a great balance between price and value. They are a great overall package, offering plenty use cases. The touchscreen is a welcomed feature and the large display size comes in a great resolution. What you get in this model is a versatile laptop where you (hopefully) will not miss any feature and have a device which will last you a long time, thanks to its metal build

2. Dell XPS 13 - *Recommended configuration*: [Dell XPS 13-Laptop – Flacher und leichter Laptop \| Dell Schweiz](<https://www.dell.com/de-ch/shop/dell-laptops/neu-xps-13-laptop/spd/xps-13-9350-intel-laptop/cn93905cc>)
    - Display
        - 13\.4 Inch, 16:10
        - Various resolutions and refresh rates, FHD suffices for 13 Inch (avoid OLED because of battery)
        - Available in Touch or Non-Touch option

    - 55Wh battery

    - 1\.2 Kg

    - Notes

        - The Dell XPS series are a bit more expensive for what you get. The reason to get an XPS model is not to get the best performance-for-money but rather excellent build quality, robustness and exceptional form factor. This model is a very compact laptop which is aesthetically pleasing and has one of the best keyboards on the market. The trackpad is invisible and top-row function bar is touch, you decide for yourself if you like this or not. Lastly, this model does not offer an HDMI output, however, all UZH monitors can be connected with USB C

3. Asus ExpertBook P5 (P5405) - *Product page*:* *[ExpertBook P5 (P5405) \| AI PC for Work \| ASUS Global](<https://www.asus.com/us/laptops/for-work/expertbook/expertbook-p5-p5405/>)

    - Display

        - 14\.0 Inch, 16:10

        - 2560 x 1600, 60Hz

        - Non-Touch

    - 63Wh battery

    - 1\.27 Kg

    - Notes

        - Since the model has not yet officially launched and it is unclear if it will be available in Switzerland, it is hard to categorize it regarding its price and value ratio. Overall, Asus laptops are considerably well built, but might lack some of the robustness compared to Dell and Lenovo. I would personally not get this laptop if the price will be above 1300 CHF, as the Lenovo variant offers better value for only slightly more money. I consider 1150 CHF to be an acceptable price for this model, which will give you laptop which offers all the functionality as the other options while cutting a few corners here and there

4. Acer Swift - *Product page*: [Acer Swift 14 AI \| Swift 16 AI \| Copilot+ PCs \| Acer Schweiz](<https://www.acer.com/ch-de/laptops/swift/swift-14-16-ai>)

    - Display

        - 14\.0 or 16.0 Inch, 16:10

        - 2560 x 1600 or 3072 x 1920, 90Hz

        - Touch and Non-Touch option (although note that non-touch is OLED)

    - 65Wh battery

    - 1\.26 Kg / 1.4 Kg

    - Notes

        - This model could be one of the best, however, it remains to be seen at which price this will come in. It offers plenty of ports, great build quality and a wonderful screen, all in a compact and light package. The camera is exceptional and overall the laptops seems to be a premium laptop with great additional features such as great speakers. Since it is not released yet, Lenovo Yoga still takes the lead, but we will keep you updated





**360° / 2-in-1 Laptops with Pen support, great if you do not have a tablet yet**

---

1. MSI Summit 13 AI+ Evo A2VM - *Product page*: [Summit 13 AI+ Evo A2VM - Determined to Succeed](<https://www.msi.com/Business-Productivity/Summit-13-AI-Plus-Evo-A2VMX/Overview>)

    - Display

        - 13\.3 Inch, 16:10

        - 1920x1200

        - Touch with Pen support

    - 70Wh battery

    - 1\.35 Kg

    - Notes

        - The MSI Summit could be the perfect balance of a conventional laptop and a convertible. It offers great ports and a huge battery for such a compact 13 inch laptop. The only uncertainty is the display brightness, which is not yet mentioned in the specifications. However, the overall usability and package should be a good pick in the 2-in-1 laptop space

2. HP OmniBook Ultra - *Product page*: [HP OmniBook Ultra KI Laptop PCs \| HP Schweiz](<https://www.hp.com/de-de/laptops-and-2-in-1s/omnibook-ultra-ai-pc.html#section=elevate-creativity>)

    - Display

        - 14\.0 Inch, 16:10

        - 2880 x 1800, 120Hz

        - Touch with Pen support

    - 64Wh battery

    - 1\.58 Kg

    - Notes

        - Overall, the OmniBook Ultra looks like a perfect 2in1 device, its only "flaw" being that the screen is OLED, which will result in less battery life compared to LCD. This is the only OLED laptop in our recommended lineup. Nevertheless, the offered features, software and exceptional metal build quality might make up for it. Again, this will largely depend on the launch price and the available ports, thus not much more can be said about this device





**Editor's pick**

---

Personally, I prefer a larger display size and enough storage in a laptop. With a larger display, I can increase the font size / zoom level and be more efficient in multitasking, for example having the lecture slides open with the personal notes next to it. Having enough storage also allows me to keep my personal data (such as photos, phone backup, ...) on the device or download local AI models (LLM).

Thus, my personal favorite is the Lenovo Slim 7i Gen 9 Aura Edition (15" Intel). On top of having a large screen and 1TB of storage, the battery is quite large, the screen offers smooth 120Hz and has touch support. Overall I find this a very compelling device, especially regarding its value-for-money proposition.

A strong second choice would be the Acer Swift 16 AI, which offers a large screen size and great overall connectivity and ports. It remains to be seen how the two devices compare in price once it is released.





**Editor's disclaimer and personal opinion**

---

Personally, I find it quite hard to recommend ARM based devices for the field of informatics, especially when it comes to Windows. Right now, devices using the Snapdragon Elite X or similar arm64-based processors, are relatively new in the market.  
This means that not all Software will run as expected on these devices (or even run at all), especially if it is a more niche or special purpose application. This might for example be the case if you start to work part-time at a small company who might use their own tools.

I have never owned or used an ARM based laptop for programming, however, I know that you will have to work with multiple languages during your studies, such as C, python, Java, Javascript, and so on... Usually, all guides that the University provides and most of the troubleshooting information online is targeted at x86 based CPUs and not ARM. I have heard that all of them can be installed and executed on ARM but I do not know how complex and different the setup is. Just be prepared that you will often have to check for compatibility and undergo some troubleshooting if you chose an ARM based windows device.

If you decide to go this path, I can recommend you the following CPU: Snapdragon Elite X1E-84-100  
Devices that use this CPU: [Snapdragon X Elite \| Snapdragon Laptops & PCs \| Qualcomm](<https://www.qualcomm.com/snapdragon/laptops>)  
The only device which is a proper convertible with Pen support is the Surface Pro 11, which I can recommend. Although I would aim for the X Plus with LCD screen in this case, both because of price and battery life.







## Windows budget options (last-gen)

If you are on a tighter budget, we also have some recommendations for you. All laptops listed below either come with 32Gb of RAM or are *upgradable from 16 to 32Gb in the future*. They are all based on the *second-latest* Intel CPU platform, Meteor Lake, Intel Ultra 7 155H. This CPU is not as efficient as the newer models but still offers the performance you need for IFIs courses. The choice for this CPU platform was made to ensure that

- the laptop can get you through your whole studies

- all of the latest AI features of Windows are supported

- all devices and monitors offered at UZH can be plugged in

- headroom is available for future hardware requirements

Inside the respective categories, the laptops are ordered by our recommendation, starting with our top pick, descending. Your choice mostly depends on where you want to cut corners and how much budget you have. We do **not** recommend to go further back in the Intel generations (13th and 14th gen), because they are experiencing manufacturing problems which leads to overheating and (till this day) can not be fixed.

    - Notes

        - The ThinkPad series is a well known classic of Lenovo and can be spotted often at the university. With its iconic design and fair pricing, this laptop does the job, especially thanks to its 32Gb of RAM. The 14" offers all the same features but in a smaller package, except that it has 16Gb of RAM.

3. Dell Inspiron 14 Plus 32Gb RAM - [*Recommended configuration*](<https://www.dell.com/de-ch/shop/dell-laptops/inspiron-14-plus-laptop/spd/inspiron-14-7440-laptop/cn74713?ref=variantstack#tech-specs-anchor> "Recommended configuration")

    - Notes

        - A wonderful combination between size, display and battery. This 2-in-1 excels with its large and vivid display and offers a great overall package.















## MacOS

Below you find our Laptop recommendations for Apple MacOS devices. If you already have an iPhone and iPad, I highly recommend you to get a Mac. If you only have an iPad, you should definitely look at the Windows alternatives though!  
All recommended laptops come with at least 16Gb of RAM, the minimum we would recommend. Having less RAM might work for most IFI courses, however, it is rather sparse for machine learning and AI. For the CPU we suggest to aim for M2 series or newer, given the latest improvements with Apple Silicon in the past years.



**MacBook Air**

---

The new MacBook Air with the Apple Silicon chip is more than enough to get you through your studies and all courses. This device offers a great compromise between budget, power and efficiency and is our top-pick if you prefer a MacOS device

- 13 or 15 Inch screen size depends on your personal preference

- We recommend to get 24Gb of RAM and the M3 processor to ensure longevity of the device, because society continuously demands more from the devices and Apple devices are not upgradeable. If cost is of concern to you, we suggest moving to the M2 chip with 24Gb of RAM

- For storage, we would aim for 1TB, because the 512Gb models are known to be much slower in read and write speeds



**MacBook Pro**

---

Although *more powerful than you need for completing your studies* at University of Zurich, the MacBook Pro is a viable solution if you have demanding tasks for it in your own projects or hobbies (such as videographer or 3D rendering)

- Again, screen size of 14 and 16 Inch depends on your personal preference

- We recommend to equip this model with at least the M3 Pro Chip, 12-Core CPU and 18-Core GPU. If you only need the power of M3, then you might as well take the MacBook Air

- Since this model is for users who work on larger projects, our minimum recommendation for RAM is 36Gb

- For storage we can only recommend to think ahead and better buy a bit more than you think you need, because it is not upgradeable. Personally, I would go with 2TB or more



## Tablet recommendation (TBD)

---

- Android

    - Samsung Tab S10 Ultra - *Product page*: [Tab S10 Ultra kaufen \| Samsung Schweiz](<https://www.samsung.com/ch/tablets/galaxy-tab-s10/buy/>)

    - Lenovo Tab Extreme - *Article*: [Lenovo presents a 14.5-inch tablet at CES 2023 - digitec](<https://www.digitec.ch/en/page/tab-extreme-lenovos-latest-tablet-shows-its-size-26062>)

- Apple

    - iPad Air 13‑inch with Apple Pencil Pro



**Where to buy**

---

Most of the mentioned devices, both Windows and MacOS, can be bought with student discount. Please check with the individual sellers websites, where you often have to sign up and verify your identity. Another platform which directly offers student discounts (also on other models) is [Projekt Neptun](<https://projektneptun.ch/de/university/>) or [edu.ch](<http://edu.ch>),however, they only have short timeframes in which they sell the laptops and specific models. Always check multiple websites for student discount on the mentioned models before buying!



**Further guidance**

---

If you have not found a suitable laptop from the list, you might want to go scout yourself for deals at Lenovo, ProjektNeptun or BrandsForStudents. We can give you some tips about what to look out for when shopping on your own, please keep in mind that these are only recommendations though:

- Display

    - 16:10 display aspect ratio

        - new and very popular format

        - more vertical screen space

        - ideal for reading documents, programming and note-taking

    - IPS display instead of OLED

        - better battery life

        - great viewing angles

        - bright (400+ nits)

    - 60Hz+

        - not necessary but smoother, especially important with Pen support

        - ensure at least 60Hz, otherwise choppy experience

        - optimal 90-120Hz, especially for touch/pen devices, above is useless

- Components

    - SSD instead of HDD

        - hard drives are outdated in todays world

        - almost identical in pricing

        - M.2 SSD (NVME) for great read & write speeds

    - Intel x86 CPU instead of AMD

        - huge compatibility with all software

        - new models are power efficient, we recommend Intel Ultra 7 258V with 32Gb RAM

        - thunderbolt support for monitors, hubs and drives

    - Battery larger than 50Wh

- Miscellaneous

    - 2x USB-C ports for charging (in case one breaks)

    - Wi-Fi 6 or newer (6e, 7)

When shopping for a MacBook it is also a good idea to look into refurbished models from [Revendo.ch,](<https://revendo.com/de-ch/kaufen/k/macbook/?p=1&properties=eac14d852a57f963157cec47406f61f4%7C6540ce89edc841113031fca391185aaf%7C94fcb25eb3cc688001ac6a73701fd68a> "Revendo.ch") however, we only recommend buying an M2 or later and with more than 16Gb of RAM.
